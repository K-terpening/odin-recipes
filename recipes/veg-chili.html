    <img src="../recipe-img/veg-chili.jpeg" width="525" height="350" alt="Vegetarian chili with black beans
    and tomatoes, topped with melted cheese,">

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This chili isn't just for the vegetarians! Packed with protien and flavor, this dish is best enjoyed in the 
            cooler seasons of autumn or winter (though you could eat it year round as well).</p>
        <p>You can aslo easily modify the recipe to your tastes. If you aren't a fan of vegetarian meat substitues, simply omit it.
            It can be made vegan by leaving out the cheese. Feel free to get creative with the seasonings as well!
